# Sharktopoda 2

_Sharktopoda 2_ will be a video player that supports MBARI's video annotation and machine learning efforts. It is a native desktop application that will support remote control from other applications via UDP. In addition, it will display rectangular regions of interest (ROIs, aka _localizations_, aka _bounding boxes_) and allow the user to interact (e.g. create, edit, delete) with them. A prototype example is illustrated at <https://youtu.be/FKeuG8-UYC0>.
