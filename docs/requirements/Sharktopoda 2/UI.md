# UI

## Overview  

## Start up

When started, Sharktopoda should show a default window like:

This window should be close when any video window is open. When all video windows are closed this window should be displayed. This is the same behavior as the [IINA video player](https://iina.io/).

Both `Open ...` and `Open URL ...` are buttons. When clicked, or the corresponding key strokes occur they should trigger their open action.

`Open ...` brings up a standard file browser.

`Open URL ...` should bring up a dialog that allows a user to enter a movie URL. This is the same behavior as `Open Location` in Apple's QuickTime player.
